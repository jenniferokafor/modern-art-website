 ## Overview
 The Modern Art Website for an art gallery created with vanilla CSS and Leaflet.js to create the map on the location.html page. It is my solution to a Frontend Mentor challenge.

 ## Built with:
 - Semantic HTML5 markup
 - CSS
 - CSS Grid
 - Flexbox
 - Leaflet.js - https://leafletjs.com/
 - Mapbox to import a map layer
 - https://www.gps-coordinates.net/ to get coordinates; general region and a specific address to place my marker.

## To-be-done: 
 - The original map design had a greyed out tile layer. I couldn't find the specific colors on my initial search using Mapbox, so I will come back to either find a pre-built layer with these colors, or design mine.
